# CSC 471 Final Project: Concert Drummer

## Overview
This is an interactive demo where the player controls a drummer on a concert stage. The player can interact with the drum set, allowing them to play basic drum grooves using the snare, hi-hat, and kick drum. When the player interacts with the guitarist, they play a guitar riff which the player can play along to on the drums.

## Dependencies
Before compiling the demo, the following libraries must be installed:
- Assimp (Model Loading)
